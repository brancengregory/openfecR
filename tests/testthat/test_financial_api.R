  #  Each report represents the summary information from Form 3, Form 3X and Form 3P. These reports have key statistics that illuminate the financial status of a given committee. Things like cash on hand, debts owed by committee, total receipts, and total disbursements are especially helpful for understanding a committee&#39;s financial dealings.  By default, this endpoint includes both amended and final versions of each report. To restrict to only the final versions of each report, use &#x60;is_amended&#x3D;false&#x60;; to retrieve only reports that have been amended, use &#x60;is_amended&#x3D;true&#x60;.  Several different reporting structures exist, depending on the type of organization that submits financial information. To see an example of these reporting requirements, look at the summary and detailed summary pages of Form 3, Form 3X, and Form 3P.
