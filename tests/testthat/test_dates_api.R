  #  Returns CSV or ICS for downloading directly into calendar applications like Google, Outlook or other applications.  Combines the election and reporting dates with Commission meetings, conferences, outreach, Advisory Opinions, rules, litigation dates and other events into one calendar.  State filtering now applies to elections, reports and reporting periods.  Presidential pre-primary report due dates are not shown on even years. Filers generally opt to file monthly rather than submit over 50 pre-primary election reports. All reporting deadlines are available at /reporting-dates/ for reference.  This is [the sql function](https://github.com/fecgov/openFEC/blob/develop/data/migrations/V40__omnibus_dates.sql) that creates the calendar.
